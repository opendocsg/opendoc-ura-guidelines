<h2 id="advisory-notes">Advisory Notes</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The guidelines set out in this handbook for the various development control parameters will generally be applied by URA in the consideration of a development application. However, if the circumstances of a case or the planning considerations relevant to a case so warrant, URA may in its discretion decide to depart from these general guidelines. Persons intending to carry out a development are advised to take this into consideration in the conduct of their affairs and check with URA through enquiries or development applications to confirm if their proposals can be allowed.

The guidelines, principles and illustrations found in the handbook series are not exhaustive in covering all possible site conditions and building designs. In evaluating the development applications, URA reserves the right to evaluate and impose conditions not covered in the handbook in respond to the specific design of the development proposal depending on merits.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="guidelines-at-a-glance">Guidelines at a Glance</h2>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Flats and condominiums are non-landed residential developments approved for dwelling purpose. Each residential unit shall have a satisfactory layout for residential purpose comprising bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, a kitchen and toilets.</p>

<p>Flats and condominiums are allowed in areas zoned Residential, Commercial &amp; Residential, Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey, White, and Residential/Institution (in the Geylang Planning Area) in the Master Plan. They are not allowed in areas designated only for landed housing developments, except for existing flats and condominiums previously approved in such areas.</p>

<p>Condominiums typically offer more generous provision of communal and recreational facilities than flats developments, and have larger <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Site-Area">Site Area</a> and more <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/Site-Area">Common Boundary Setback</a>.</p>

<p>For sites zoned Commercial/Residential or Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey, refer to the <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Non-Residential/Commercial">Commercial Handbook</a> for the relevant guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="serviced-apartments-akin-to-residential-use">Serviced Apartments (akin to Residential Use)</h2>

<p>Serviced Apartments (SA) may be allowed in Residential zone and may also be considered on mixed-use sites where residential use may be allowed. SAs are self-contained apartments with kitchenettes/kitchens, and provide support services such as concierge, common dining areas, housekeeping and/or laundry for the residents.</p>

<p>SAs shall be rented out for lodging purposes for a minimum period of 7 days or longer, and shall be developed and/or managed under one ownership. Strata subdivision of SAs is strictly not allowed.</p>

<p>Support services such as concierge, housekeeping and/or laundry provided for the residents of Serviced Apartments may be allowed. In addition, limited bar/lounge facilities may be permitted, subject to a maximum of 0.3% of the total residential GFA.</p>

<h3 id="sas-within-residential-zones-incl-mixed-use-sites-with-a-residential-component">SAs within Residential zones (incl. mixed use sites with a residential component)</h3>

<p>Applicants may submit an Outline Application to URA to determine the suitability of the location, the Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) control and the storey height for a proposed SA development.</p>

<p>SAs may be allowed where the site fronts a major or arterial road (ie Category 1, 2, 3 roads or equivalent) at the fringe of a residential area; or the site is located in a mixed-use area (eg commercial centres, business parks, or abutting medical hubs).</p>

<p>SAs shall not be allowed within the designated Landed Housing Areas; areas where SAs may potentially cause dis-amenities to the neighbouring residents; and areas where there are already dis-amenities in the surroundings (examples of such areas can be found under the <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/~/link.aspx?_id=D6552D95F1DE4CE3ABB700371F96772E&amp;_z=z">Hotels Handbook</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sas-within-mixed-use-areas">SAs within mixed-use areas</h3>

<p>SAs may be considered in mixed-use areas and are not restricted by the category of roads fronting the site. </p>

<h2 id="gross-plot-ratio">Gross Plot Ratio</h2>

<p>The development potential of a residential development is guided by the Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) specified in the Master Plan (MP). The MP plot ratio is the upper bound as it may not always be achievable because of site limitations like shape of the plot, site topography or ground conditions, building setbacks, building height or technical requirements of other authorities that may affect the site.</p>

<p>The area of the land required to be set aside for drainage reserve<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> (DR) and/or road reserve<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> (RR) to be vested in the State may be included in the site area to compute the Gross Floor Area (GFA) for a GPR.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/F01_Gross_Plot_Ratio.jpg" alt="Alternative text if image doesn't load" />
<em>GPR for sites where vesting is required</em></p>

<h2 id="bonus-gfa-incentive-schemes">Bonus GFA Incentive Schemes</h2>

<p>The Bonus GFA schemes applicable to flats and condominiums are:</p>

<p><strong>Balcony Incentive Scheme</strong></p>

<p>Refer to section on <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/~/link.aspx?_id=073E26836E5A406892CF59BA9A501130&amp;_z=z">Balconies, Private Enclosed Spaces, Private Roof Terraces, &amp; Indoor Recreation Spaces</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conserved Bungalows Scheme</strong></p>

<p>The GFA of conserved bungalows may be computed as additional GFA over and above the GPR stipulated in the prevailing Master Plan.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eligibility:</p>

<p>The incentive is applicable to all bungalows meeting the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Volunteered for conservation or designated for conservation by URA; and</li>
  <li>Located on a site with GPR control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional GFA from the bungalow shall be exempted from payment of Development Charge.</p>

<p>Submission:</p>

<p>Submissions of Development Applications involving conserved bungalows shall be made only by a Qualified Person (QP), who is registered as an Architect under the Architects Act and who has in force a practising certificate issued under the Act.</p>

<p>The QP shall demarcate the area of the conserved bungalow in the submission and declare the additional GFA from the conserved bungalow in the application form.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Indoor Recreation Spaces Scheme</strong></p>

<p>Refer to section on <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Residential/Flats-Condominiums/~/link.aspx?_id=073E26836E5A406892CF59BA9A501130&amp;_z=z">Balconies, Private Enclosed Spaces, Private Roof Terraces, &amp; Indoor Recreation Spaces</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Bonus GFA is allowed over and above the MP GPR subject to a maximum of 10% of the MP GPR. When the site is redeveloped in future, the additional GFA already used under the bonus GFA incentive schemes shall not be carried over. In other words, the GPR for the site shall revert to the GPR specified in the prevailing MP.</p>

<p>Although a site may make use of multiple bonus GFA incentive schemes, the total bonus GFA shall not exceed the overall cap of 10% above the MP GPR.</p>

<h2 id="balconies-private-enclosed-spaces-private-roof-terraces-and-indoor-recreation-spaces">Balconies, Private Enclosed Spaces, Private Roof Terraces and Indoor Recreation Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Balconies</strong></p>

<p>The GFA of balconies in flats and condominium developments may be computed over and above the Master MP allowable GPR, subject to a cap of 7% inclusive of planter boxes, if any. The additional GPR may only be used for balcony GFA and shall not form the future development potential of the site upon redevelopment. The additional balcony GFA shall be subject to payment of Development Charge or Differential Premium, where applicable. When submitting development proposals with balconies, the QP is required to demarcate the balcony area clearly on the Calculation Plan and declare the total balcony area that exceeds the MP allowable GPR.</p>

<p>Existing developments whose GPR have exceeded the Master Plan intensity may qualify for the additional balcony GFA, subject to a cap of 7% of the existing and approved GPR inclusive of planter boxes, if any. This does not apply to existing developments whose building form, height or use are not in accordance with the planning intention of the Master Plan, Building Height Plan or Special and Detailed Control Plan. For instance, a flats development within a designated landed housing area shall not qualify for the bonus balcony GFA.</p>

<p>Balcony designs shall adhere to the following guidelines and submission requirements:</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Recreation Spaces</strong></p>

<p>Private non-landed residential developments and the residential component of mixed-use developments may apply for the communal indoor recreation spaces to be counted as bonus GFA, provided such spaces are more than 0.6% of the total GFA of the development or 10sqm (whichever is higher). The bonus GFA shall be capped at 1% of total GFA, or the GFA of the residential component for mixed-use developments.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/GFA11_Bonus_GFA_Indoor_Recreational_Space.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the proposed communal indoor recreation spaces are less than 0.6% of the total GFA of the development or 10sqm (whichever is higher), these spaces shall be counted under the main building GFA instead of bonus GFA.</p>

<p>Examples of communal indoor recreation spaces that may qualify for this scheme include gyms, function rooms, libraries, game rooms and reading rooms. Developers may propose other forms of communal indoor recreation spaces for URA’s evaluation. These spaces shall be retained as common property and kept accessible to residents of the development. They shall only be used for non-commercial purposes.</p>

<p>The indoor recreation space bonus GFA scheme shall apply to all development applications for new erection, amendments to approved developments or additions and alterations (A&amp;A) of existing private non-landed residential developments or mixed-use developments with a residential component.</p>

<p>All additional GFA granted under the indoor recreation space bonus GFA scheme shall not form the future development potential of the site.</p>

<h2 id="maximum-number-of-dwelling-units">Maximum Number of Dwelling Units</h2>

<p>The following Dwelling Unit (DU) size controls shall not apply to HDB flats and Serviced Apartments, and developments within the <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Flats-Condominiums/Central_Area_Map.pdf?la=en">Central Area (PDF, 436 KB)</a>.</p>

<p>As a guide, all self-contained DUs island-wide shall be more than 35sqm nett in internal area.</p>

<p>The formulae in the following tabs for calculating the maximum allowable number of DUs are intended to derive an upper bound figure1. The actual number of DUs that may be supported in any development shall be assessed based on the site context, existing site conditions and the impact on the local infrastructure. URA shall assess the overall layout, design and unit sizes of the residential development proposals, and may add other requirements where necessary to protect the quality of the living environment.</p>

<p>There shall be provision of a good mix of unit sizes including larger DUs that can cater to the needs of larger families. An example is a development where about 20% of the DUs have a nett internal area of at least 100sqm, excluding voids, balconies, air-conditioner ledges and other external areas, and units of nett internal area less than 50sqm shall not exceed about 20% of the proposed DUs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>For flats and condominiums outside the Central Area</strong></p>

<p>For all flats and condominium developments outside the Central Area, excluding the estates shown in Maps 2-10 (PDF, 1.93 MB), the maximum number of allowable DUs per residential development shall be determined based on the following formula:</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/DU_Calculation_85sqm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>2 Excludes bonus GFA (ie if the proposal is a mixed development, only the proposed GFA for the residential component shall be used in the calculation, excluding bonus GFA).</p>

<p>3 The GFA of any proposed strata landed units shall be excluded from the calculation in the formula.</p>

<p><strong>For flats and condominiums within the estates in Maps 2-10</strong></p>

<p>For all flats and condominium developments in the estates outlined in Maps 2-10 (PDF, 1.93 MB) a more stringent DU guide shall be used. The maximum number of allowable DUs per residential development within these estates shall be determined based on the following formula:</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/DU_Calculation_100sqm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>2 Excludes bonus GFA (ie if the proposal is a mixed development, only the proposed GFA for the residential component shall be used in the calculation, excluding bonus GFA).</p>

<p>3 The GFA of any proposed strata landed units shall be excluded from the calculation in the formula.</p>

<h2 id="site-area">Site Area</h2>

<p>The minimum site area for a flats and condominium development is 1,000sqm and 4,000sqm respectively. Condominiums require larger site area to ensure that there is sufficient space for more communal and recreational facilities.</p>

<p>For proposals where terrace or semi-detached houses breakaway for redevelopment into flats &amp; condominiums, the remaining adjacent lots shall be capable of redevelopment into flats &amp; condominiums. The remaining adjacent lots are known as left-behind lots, and shall fulfil the minimum site area of 1,000sqm.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/F02_Minimum_Site_Area.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Minimum Site Area for Left-Behind Plots</em></p>

<p><strong>Conditions under which the minimum site area of 1000 sqm may be waived</strong></p>

<p>The owner(s) of the left-behind lot(s) do not wish to participate in the redevelopment despite being informed of the limited development potential of his/their land after it is left out of the redevelopment; and</p>

<p>An agreement cannot be reached between the owner(s) of the left-behind lot(s) and the owner of the redevelopment proposal after extensive discussion. There shall be clear documentary evidence of prior negotiation with the owner(s) of the left-behind lot(s).</p>

<h2 id="site-coverage">Site Coverage</h2>

<p>Site coverage ensures that there are adequate areas set aside for greenery and landscaping within the development.</p>

<p>The computation of site coverage has been simplified to include all building structures that protrude more than 1m from the ground as seen from the top-down ‘Site Plan’ view, and is expressed as a percentage of the net site area. The net site area refers to the area of the site excluding areas to be vested to the State for public roads, public road widening reserves1, and drainage reserves2.</p>

<p>The maximum site coverage for flats and condominiums is 50%.</p>

<p>In the Development Application, the Site Plan shall include a separate site coverage layer for computation purposes. An example is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/SC01_Site_Coverage_Plan_Flats.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Example of a Site Coverage Plan for Flats or Condominum Developments</em></p>

<p>1 Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.</p>

<p>2 Drainage Reserve (DR): An area safeguarded for purposes of building or widening a public drain.</p>

<h2 id="building-setback-from-boundary">Building Setback from Boundary</h2>

<p><img src="/opendoc-ura-guidelines/assets/F04_Road_Buffer_and_Setback.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>lats and condominiums shall be sufficiently set back from the road and common boundary. The setback distance is measured from the road reserve1 line or boundary line to the external wall of the flats, excluding land to be vested to the State for road or drainage or public purpose.</p>

<p>The setback for flats and condominiums from public roads are determined by the road buffer, which is dependent on the category of the road that the site fronts and the height of development. For roads that are not categorised, the minimum road buffer of 7.5m applies. A green buffer shall also be set aside within the road buffer. The classification of the road category may be obtained from LTA’s Road Interpretation Plan (RIP).</p>

<p>The type of road buffer &amp; setback are shown in the diagram above, and are detailed in Tables 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>Bay windows, ledges, roof eaves and other minor building features may encroach into the setback distance up to the extent shown in Table 3 below.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the setback and buffer requirements are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sites with street block controls (refer to the Street Block Plans section);</li>
  <li>Party-wall3 developments (to be assessed upon formal submission of a proposed development);</li>
  <li>Flats and condominium developments within the River Valley, Newton and Orchard Planning Areas. The standard road buffer for these shall be 7.5m (of which 3m is green buffer);</li>
  <li>Flats and condominium developments in the Central Area (PDF, 436 KB) other than those in the River Valley, Newton and Orchard Planning Areas. The required road buffer shall be based on urban design considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p>1 Road Reserve: The plot of land to be vested in the State as required under the Street Works Act. It is demarcated by the line of Road Reserve in the Road Line Plan and the site boundary.</p>
